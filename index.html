                <div class="modal-body">Espresso is a coffee-brewing method of Italian origin, in which a small 
                    amount of nearly boiling water (about 90 °C or 190 °F) is forced under 9–10 bars 
                    (900–1,000 kPa; 130–150 psi) of pressure through finely-ground coffee beans. Espresso can be 
                    made with a wide variety of coffee beans and roast degrees. Espresso is the most common way 
                    of making coffee in southern Europe, especially in Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal. It is 
                    also popular in Switzerland, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Greece, and Australia.</div>

                    Italy and is prepared with steamed milk foam (microfoam).
                    Variations of the drink involve the use of cream instead of milk, using non-dairy milk 
                    substitutes and flavoring with cinnamon or chocolate powder. It is typically smaller in 
                    volume than a caffè latte, with a thicker layer of microfoam.</div>

                    ice before or after beating the coffee and custom additives such as sugar, milk, 
                    vanilla, and sweet sauces. It depends on what you are shaking or blending it in: 
                    a shaker, frappé maker or blender. An ice-crushing blender is better than a shaker 
                    for blending a frappé. </div>

                    with notes of chocolate, caramel, earthy spices like cinnamon or nutmeg, and fruity 
                    flavors such as raspberry or orange blossom, which can come from their addition.</div>

                    two-demitasse cup. It is important to note, that an Americano is created by adding the water 
                    to an already extracted espresso, not by extracting extra water through a single espresso puck. </div>
